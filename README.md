Degen Gaming Token (DGN) - ERC20 on Avalanche Fuji Testnet
This project implements a ERC20 token named "Degen" (DGN) for Degen Gaming on the Avalanche Fuji Testnet.

Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

NodeJS (v16 or later): https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current
Git: https://www.git-scm.com/downloads
Clone the Project:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/degen-gaming-token.git
cd degen-gaming-token
Install Dependencies:

npm install
Project Structure:

contracts: Contains the Solidity smart contract for the DGN token.
hardhat: Configuration files for the Hardhat development environment.
scripts: Scripts for deploying and testing the contract.
README.md: This file (you are reading it now).
tests: Unit tests for the smart contract functionality.
Smart Contract (contracts/DGN.sol):

This file defines the ERC20 token contract with the following functionalities:

Minting: Only the contract owner can mint new tokens.
Transferring: Players can transfer their tokens to other accounts.
Redeeming: Functionality for redeeming tokens in the in-game store is not implemented yet (placeholder comments included).
Balance Check: Anyone can check the balance of any account.
Burning: Anyone can burn their own tokens.
Deployment and Testing:

Configure Avalanche Fuji Testnet:

Follow the instructions on https://docs.avax.network/build/subnet/utility/avalanche-subnet-faucet to set up a node or connect to an existing one.
Update the .env file with your Avalanche Fuji node URL and private key for the deploying account.
Deploy the Contract:

npx hardhat deploy
Run Tests:

npx hardhat test
Verification:

After successful deployment, use Snowtrace (https://snowtrace.io/token/0x38eac20ac741eca1e0ebdc356fd57ae9963c06fd) to verify the contract on the Avalanche Fuji Testnet.

Sharing the Smart Contract:

Copy the contract address from the deployment output.
You can share the contract address and the code on Github.
Additional Notes:

This is a basic implementation and can be further extended with features like in-game store integration and access control for minting.
Remember to replace your-username in the clone command with your actual Github username.
Always test thoroughly before deploying to a mainnet.
Security Considerations:

This is an educational project and should not be used in production environments without proper audits.
Be cautious about granting minting privileges to the contract owner.
Consider implementing access control mechanisms for specific functions (e.g., minting).
This project provides a starting point for creating a ERC20 token for Degen Gaming on the Avalanche Fuji Testnet. Feel free to customize and expand upon it based on your specific needs.
